Tired of the `Cmd+C` -> Open Browser -> Type "Google Translate" -> `Cmd+V` -> Cry -> Repeat cycle? 

Yeah, us too. That's why we built **TransPop**. It's like having a Babel fish in your menu bar, but less slimy.

## Why TransPop? 🧐

Because life is too short to manually copy-paste text into a browser tab.

### 🌟 Features that will make you go "Wow"

*   **The "Double Tap" Magic**: Press `Cmd+C` twice (Double Copy). Boom! Translation pops up. It's like summoning a genie, but for languages. 🧞‍♂️
*   **Mini Popup Mode**: The window appears *right where your cursor is*. We call it "Ninja Mode". You don't even have to move your mouse. 🥷
*   **Tray Icon**: We live in your status bar. Always watching. Always waiting. (In a non-creepy way). 👀
*   **Real Translation**: Powered by Google Translate (the free one, shh 🤫). No fake "Lorem Ipsum" here.
*   **Language Swap**: One click to reverse the flow. `English -> Chinese` becomes `Chinese -> English`. Mind = Blown. 🤯
*   **Dark Mode**: Because we are developers and light mode burns our retinas. 😎

## 🛠 Tech Stack (The Nerd Stuff)

Built with pure, unadulterated **Swift** and **SwiftUI**. No Electron. No Chrome instances eating your RAM. Just pure, native performance. 🍏

*   **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI that looks good on macOS.
*   **AppKit**: For the nitty-gritty window management and status bar magic.
*   **Combine**: For reactive state management.
